# NYC Taxi Data

## Overview
The goal of this project was to develop an entire ETL Pipeline from start to finish. We chose the NYC Taxi dataset. 
We used technologies like streamlit to display our visuals, postgres to store our data, jupyter notebook to code it all, and docker. We used the API connected to the dataset which was found in the nYC open data website. Our API key looked like this: "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/4b4i-vvec.json".

## Postgres setup
- Created PostgreSQL database `taxi_data` using `psycopg2`.
- A normalized relational schema using lookup tables and foreign keys:
  - `vendors`, `rate_codes`, `payment_types`, `locations` (lookup tables)
  - `trips` (fact table referencing the lookups)
- Populated all lookup tables with meaningful values.
- Parsed and loaded cleaned taxi trip data into the normalized schema.
- Verified data loading with SQL joins and row count checks.

Created the ERD for our database to visually represent table relationships. This diagram helped guide our schema decisions.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the "proj docker" folder
2. Make a .env file which should look like this (change the actual values of the variables):
   ```python
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin
    POSTGRES_DB=taxi_data
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:admin@db:5432/taxi_data
4. Next, run "docker-compose up --build"
5. Copy and paste the URL in a browser of your choice. Replace the 0.0.0.0 with localhost. So the URL should look like "http://localhost:8501". Below is a screenshot of the streamlit dashboard and what should come up on your screen too.
